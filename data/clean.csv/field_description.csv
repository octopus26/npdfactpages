EKOFISK,Development,"Ekofisk is an oil field located in the southern part of the North Sea. The water depth in the area is 70 - 75 metres. The field was produced to tankers until a concrete storage tank was installed in 1973. Since then, the field has been further developed with many facilities, including riser facilities for associated fields and export pipelines. Several of these have been decommissioned and are awaiting disposal. Today, the operative parts of the Ekofisk Centre consist of the accommodation facilities, Ekofisk H and Ekofisk Q, the production facility Ekofisk C, the drilling and production facility Ekofisk X, the processing facility Ekofisk J and the production and processing facility Ekofisk M. From the wellhead facility Ekofisk A, located in the southern part of the field, production goes to the riser facility Ekofisk FTP for processing at the Ekofisk Centre. The pipeline from production facility Ekofisk B in the northern part of the field is routed to Ekofisk M. Ekofisk K is a facility for water injection. A plan for water injection at Ekofisk was approved in December 1983, a PDO for Ekofisk II was approved in November 1994 and a PDO for Ekofisk Growth was approved in June 2003. In June 2008 a subsea template for water injection wells was approved. These have replaced the water injection at Ekofisk W, which is no longer in use. In March 2010, the new accommodation facility, Ekofisk L, was approved. This will replace Ekofisk H and Ekofisk Q. Ekofisk L will be in operation from autumn 2013. Permanent cables have been installed on the seabed over the Ekofisk reservoir for acquisition of seismic data. A PDO for Ekofisk Sør was approved in June 2011.

EKOFISK,Reservoir,"The Ekofisk field produces from naturally fractured chalk in the Ekofisk and Tor Formations of Early Paleocene and Late Cretaceous ages. The reservoir rocks have high porosity, but low permeability. The reservoir has an oil column of more than 300 metres and lies 2 900 - 3 250 metres below sea level.",43506,2013-05-01
EKOFISK,Recovery strategy,"Ekofisk was originally developed by pressure depletion and had an expected recovery factor of 17 per cent. Since then, limited gas injection and comprehensive water injection have contributed to a substantial increase in oil recovery. Large scale water injection started in 1987, and in subsequent years the area for water injection has been extended in several phases. Experience has proven that water displacement of the oil is more effective than anticipated, and the expected recovery factor for Ekofisk is now approximately 50 per cent. In addition to the water injection, compaction of the soft chalk provides extra force to drainage of the field. The reservoir compaction has resulted in subsidence of the seabed, which is now more than 9 metres in the central part of the field. It is expected that the subsidence will continue for many years, but at a lower rate.",43506,2013-05-01

VARG,Transport,"Oil is off-loaded from the production vessel onto tankers. All the gas is injected, but a solution for possible gas export in the future is being considered.",43451,2012-08-23
VARG,Status,"Varg is in the tail phase, but the field is expected to produce until 2021. A gas pipeline will be installed between Varg and Rev, in order to export the gas via the CATS pipeline system to the UK. Measures to optimise recovery are being considered. In 2011 water alternating gas injection (WAG) started, and the first gas cycles had positive effects. A new drilling campaign with two infill producers has started, and several are planned for the coming years. The 15/12-21 (Grevling) discovery, proven in 2009, may be connected to Varg, which can prolong the lifetime of the Varg field.",43451,2013-05-03

ÅSGARD,Development,"Åsgard is located centrally in the Norwegian Sea. The water depth in the area is 240 – 300 metres. Åsgard includes the discoveries 6506/12-1 Smørbukk, 6506/12-3 Smørbukk Sør and 6507/11-1 Midgard. The field has been developed with subsea completed wells tied back to a production and storage vessel, “Åsgard A”, which produces and stores oil, and a floating, semisubmersible facility, Åsgard B, for gas and condensate processing. The gas centre is connected to a storage vessel for condensate, Åsgard C. The Åsgard field has been developed in two phases. The liquid phase came on stream in 1999 and the gas export phase started October 2000.The Åsgard facilities are an important part of the Norwegian Sea infrastructure where gas from Mikkel is processed, and injection gas is delivered to Tyrihans. The Morvin field is tied back to Åsgard B.",43765,2013-05-03
ÅSGARD,Reservoir,"The Smørbukk deposit is a rotated fault block, bordered by faults in the west and north and structurally deeper areas to the south and east. The reservoir formations Garn, Ile, Tofte, Tilje and Åre are of Jurassic age and contain gas, condensate and oil. The Smørbukk Sør deposit, with reservoir rocks in the Garn, Ile and Tilje Formations contains oil, gas and condensate. The Midgard gas deposits are divided into four structural segments with the main reservoir in the Garn and Ile Formations. The sandstone reservoirs lie at depths of as much as 4 850 metres. The reservoir quality varies between the formations, and there are large differences in porosity and permeability between the three deposits.",43765,2013-05-03
ÅSGARD,Recovery strategy,"Smørbukk Sør is produced by pressure support from gas injection. Smørbukk is produced partly by pressure depletion and partly by injection of excess gas from the field. Midgard is produced by pressure depletion. Converting gas injection wells into gas production wells at Smørbukk has started, and the technology makes it possible to switch between injection and production. This will maintain both gas injection in Smørbukk and Smørbukk Sør and gas export volume from Åsgard. I addition, a project on optimisation of the drainage strategy on Smørbukk Sør has started. The plan is to mature the project with a phased development with production start-up of the first phase in 2015 and the second phase, depending on the results of the first phase, a few years later. Establishment of a gas compression facility at Midgard was approved in 2012 and start-up of the facility is planned for 2015. This facility is needed to maintain the gas stream in the pipeline from Mikkel and Midgard to Åsgard B. A stable supply of low CO2 gas from Mikkel and Midgard is also important for dilution of the high CO2 gas from Kristin in the Åsgard Transport to Kårstø.",43765,2013-05-03
ÅSGARD,Transport,Oil and condensate are temporarily stored at the field and shipped to land by tankers. The gas is exported through Åsgard Transport to Kårstø. The condensate from Åsgard is sold as oil (Halten Blend).,43765,2012-08-23
ÅSGARD,Status,"Most of the production wells have been drilled, and efforts are being made to increase recovery from the field, partly by drilling infill wells and sidetrack wells (TTRD wells). Implementing Åsgard A and B low pressure production is also being evaluated. Phase I is a planned to start operation in 2013, and phase II in 2015. Other efforts for increasing recovery from Åsgard include prolonging the lifetime of Åsgard A. Prolonging the economic lifetime of Åsgard B is also a focus area. An appraisal well in 2009 proved oil and gas in a new segment northeast of Smørbukk. The deposit will be tied-in to Åsgard B, with planned production start in 2013. There are other proven resources in the area with low CO2 gas. Work is being done to realise these via Mikkel and Midgard to Åsgard B. In addition, technical studies considering third-party discoveries as tie-back candidates to Åsgard are ongoing.",43765,2013-05-03
